//Bookworm: Introduction

//In this project we're going o build an app to track which books you've read and what you though of them, and it's going to follow a similar theme to project 10: let's take all the skill you've already mastereed, then add some bonus new skills that take them all to a new level.

//This time you're going to meed Core Data, which is Apple's battle hardenend framework fo working wih databases. This project will serve as an introduction for Core Data, but we'll be going into much more detail soon.

//At the same time, we're also going to build our first custon user interdace component - a star rating widget where the user can tap to leave a score for each book. This will mean introducing you to another property wrapper, called @Binding - trust me, it will all make sense.

//As usual we're going to start with a walkthrough of all the new techniques you neeed for this project, so pplease create a new iOS app called Bookworm, using Single View App project template.
